# DiscreteCosineTransform
Performs a discrete cosine transform on given data, can also use polynomial modeling

This program was created to model discrete points of data with a curve created from the summation of cosines. NASDAQ 100 data is provided for testing.
Additionally, the user can use polynomials to model the data, or a combination of the two techniques. The number of cosines and degree of the polynomial can be changed to suit the data.
